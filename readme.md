Hey all, this is a personal thing I wanted to do as I did miss the old pre 10.10 icons of Mac OSX, this theme mixs a few things but is mostly resembling the 10.6 look give or take.  This is mostly designed for KDE but I do presume it can work on others too (untested) 
Shout out to nooblabs for some of the older icon packs that where good sources.
